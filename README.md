**Part 3 Submision -----------------------------------**
1. Addressing Feedback: We have addressed the feedback from Project Part 2. Added story points to our product backlog, as well as more explanation to grouping certain stories together. Modified the storyboard with more detail and a more streamlined layout (and to adjust to the changes made during Project Part 3). Added more details to the CRC cards.
2. Code Base of Prototype: The most up to date code is in the main branch for project part 3.
3. Code Documentation: JavaDocs have been added to all classes, and comments have been added to large chunks of code.
4. Test Cases: Test cases have been developed, primarily for UI testing and unit testing.
5. Object-Oriented Design:
6. Product Backlog: A new milestone has been created with the remaining requirements, with assignee decisions to be made after Project Part 3
7. UI Mockups and Storyboard Sequences: These have been updated based on our current application, as well as to address feedback from Project Part 2
8. Sprint Planning and Reviews:
9. Demonstration: Demo to be conducted during the lab after reading week.
10. Tools: Github (for product backlog, version control, and documentation), Figma (for UI mockups), Google Drawings (for storyboard sequences, CRC cards, and UML), UMLet (for UML), Excel (for sprint planning and review documentation), and Discord (for communication)
